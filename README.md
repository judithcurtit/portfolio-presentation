Assignement: create a portfolio website

## Getting Started
Inspiration from a template I found on gitHub:
https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-agency/
mixed with the personal website prepared as a pre-assignemnt

### Prerequisite
Prepare a portfolio website with a README page using what we've learned so far.

### Layout
* First part: pic as a background with toggle naviguation bar
* second part/services: quick presentation about me as I don't provide services for now.
* Third part/portfolio: no project to show so I've jsut put regualr information. 
I wanted the icons to be in another position but I didn't have time to fix it.
* Fourth part/About: bullet points to be replaced by icons for a better look.
* Fifth part/pictures: ajax/jquery to get the pictures.
* Sixth part/Contact Form: I took it from the startbootstrap/agency.
* Seventh part/social media

### Installing
Toogle NavBar: I got it from Bootstrap:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/

Smooth Scrolling: was suggested in Rocket chat

## Things to fix
Problem with the pictures in the photo-album. When resizing, there is white space on the right side.
when clicking on the pagination in the photo-album it will go to the bottom of the page.
I would have like to put more effects.

## Versioning
Trouble with GitHub (again!)
